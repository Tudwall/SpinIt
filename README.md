![Logo de Spin It](./assets/icons/SpintIt-lineson.svg "logo de SpinIt!")

Personal project for my web developer course by AFEC, the goal is to use everything learned during the course to make a website.  
This website is a tracking service for all your favorite music releases, just like Discogs which inspired me a lot functionality-wise.
